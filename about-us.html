                    <p>
                        A complete design and build company you can trust.<br/>
                        MAL Associates are built on an outstanding reputation that precedes it. Our teams of professional Architects and Engineers provide you with a teamwork service on your project.<br/>
                        We will work closely and directly with you through the entire process to ensure you get the most appropriate and functional space. Forethought is put into every detail and considerations are made for future space needs and applications.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Adaptable and flexible
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        With in-house project managers, designers, engineers and trades, we can readily adapt to scope changes and requirements as they arise. 
                        Changes are part of project construction and we are ready to assist and ensure successful completion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Affordable

                    <p>
                        The design-build approach includes efficiencies and quality assurance that do not come with hiring a general contractor and a series of trades. 
                        Design-build is a cost-effective approach that ensures a dedicated project manager is responsible for the process and quality of the project. 
                        We aim to maximise the potential of the property within the clientâ€™s budget.
